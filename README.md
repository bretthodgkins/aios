# aios
A personal assistant / automation software that allows users to speak to their computers in natural language, teach it high level commands and automate complex tasks. AIOS utilises the openCV computer vision library to recognise images on the screen, so it can dynamically interact with any user interface and wait for programs/websites to load.
